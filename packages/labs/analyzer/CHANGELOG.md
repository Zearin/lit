- [#3507](https://github.com/lit/lit/pull/3507) [`b152db29`](https://github.com/lit/lit/commit/b152db291932aa25356543395251a9b42e12292d) - Added superclass analysis to ClassDeclaration, along with the ability to query exports of a Module (via `getExport()` and `getResolvedExport()`) and the ability to dereference `Reference`s to the `Declaration` they point to (via `dereference()`).
